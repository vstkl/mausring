# mousring

## what and why

Main idea is to create a mouse-like device in form factor of a ring, utilising accelerometer for movements with rotary outer ring allowing for scrolling through endless documentation and specification that we all eventually will face.
The motivation behind this project is me being lazy to put my hand back on touchpad/mouse everytime I need to go to next page of the document while my hands are busy drinking coffee or whatever. 
So for sake of laziness and learning I've decided to try to make my ideal device reality and surely, I will come across some obstacles so I will try my best to document lessons learned in the circuit development, in programming of the software and many more.

## dev toolchain

current toolchain for 3d design is jupyter notebook, utilizing [jupyterscad](https://github.com/jreiberkyle/jupyterscad) and [solid2](https://github.com/jeff-dh/SolidPython), with some helpful tweaks to original [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)
for schematic and PCB design I'm using [EasyEDA Pro](https://pro.easyeda.com/editor) and parts included, eventually maybe with some extensions or community-defined parts. We will see.
