## The Vision

Imagine breaking free from desks. No more bulky mice. Just fluid, natural cursor control at your fingertip. Enter MausRing: the first ring-worn pointing device that brings true mobility and minimalism to digital navigation.

## From Garage Prototype to Sleek Device

What began as a DIY hacker’s project—optical sensor, microcontroller, lithium cell—evolved through multiple 3D‑printed iterations into a polished hardware experience. Early prototypes helped perfect comfort, ergonomics, and responsiveness. Each revision shrunk size and boosted usability, guided by hands‑on testing for tap-based clicking and gesture scrolling.

## How It Works

Motion detection via optical sensor translates fingertip movement into cursor motion.

Tap sensors detect light index + ring finger taps for left/right clicks.

Gesture scrolling lets you move vertically by sliding fingers.

Wireless Bluetooth connection ensures cable‑free movement.

The goal: intuitive, fast interaction without adding noise or desk dependence.

## Why Back It?

Mobility: control your screen while cooking, walking, or presenting.

Ergonomics: no wrist strain from traditional mice; keeps hands free.

Cool factor: futuristic minimalism meets everyday functionality.

## Roadmap & Goals

Alpha prototypes built from the open‑source GitHub hardware/software repo.

Beta testing with dozens to refine form factor and UX.

Final design: refined shell, polished firmware, production-quality Bluetooth stack.

Scale manufacture: small-batch manufacture followed by stretch goals for metal rings, multiple sizes, and customization options.

Community involvement: early backers vote on color, pledge for wireless charging dock or plush case extras.
